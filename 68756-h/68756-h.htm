<p class="center larger">To the <span class="gesperrt">PUBLIC</span>.</p>

<p>I have very long been convinced of
the many dangerous Consequences
which attend the depraved Custom of employing
Men-midwives unnecessarily—and
have been for some Years intending
from Month to Month to write my Ideas
on that Subject, in order to combat the
very destructive Practice, and endeavour
to awaken the slumbering good Sense of the
Nation. But when I reflected on the great
Difficulty of conquering Prejudice—considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
how generally the Opinion had been
adopted that “Men were the most proper
Attendants on the Labours of Women,”
I confess the Task appeared too
arduous—and I was discouraged.</p>

<p>I knew, that <i>no</i> Arguments, <i>even if an
Angel was to descend from Heaven to utter
them</i>, could persuade the Ladies <i>to be satisfied</i>
with Midwives of <i>their own</i> Sex,
<i>after the fine Polish</i> had been <i>once</i>
RUB’D OFF which <i>modesty ought</i>
to have <i>work’d up</i> to such a <i>bright</i> Pitch of
<i>high finish’d</i> Excellence, as <i>not</i> to have been
capable of admitting the impure stain
within the glossy smoothness of its beautiful
enamel!—I knew, that, assisted by
the greatest Part of the Faculty (whose <i><span class="smcap">interest</span>,
as well as <span class="smcap">pleasure</span></i> would be
at <span class="smcap">stake</span>) they would leave <i>no means</i> untried—they
would call in <i>every fallacious</i>
art to their aid, <i>to continue <span class="smcap">the deception</span></i>,
by <i>ridiculing</i> Arguments which they
<i>could not confute</i>—and that <i>un</i>married Ladies,
through <i>an Opinion</i> of the <i>Virtue of
their Friends</i>, and swayed, and <i>kept in
Countenance</i>, by <i>the prevalent</i> Custom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
the Times, would naturally <i>fall into the
Stream</i>, and <i>not</i> be undeceived until <i>too
far hurried by the Current</i> to be <i>afterwards</i>
able to recede.—On the other Hand, I
likewise knew that our young Men <i>of Fashion</i>
had <i>long ago</i> resolved <i>to bid Adieu <span class="smcap">to
thinking</span></i>. Leaving <i>that troublesome</i> Employment
<i>to others</i>, they were intent on
pursuing the far nobler Gratifications <i>of
Sense</i>—endeavouring to bury in a round
of <i>trifling</i> Dissipations, <i>every</i> Sentiment
meriting the Attention of <i>reasonable</i> Beings
that an Attempt to work on <i>such</i> Minds
would be Absurdity in the extreme,—for,
that, even <i>if they were convinced</i> of the two
uncontrovertable Truths I wish to establish,
by being satisfied that Men were
<i>not</i> so safe as Women, and that Men-midwives
polluted the Minds of their Wives,
and rendered them easy Preys to Seduction,
yet these Sentiments would have had <i>no</i>
Weight <i>with them</i>, because they married
without Love, Religion, Principle—<i>the
only</i> Ingredients capable of forming <i>national</i>
Happiness. <i>Impure</i> in their <i>Souls, debauch’d</i>
in their <i>Persons</i>, Libertinism opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
<i>the only Avenue</i> which could present
them with a Prospect of Enjoyments <i>adapted
to their</i> Sensations—<i>their</i> Joys were
independent of their Wive’s Society—their
Healths consequently were only <i>politely</i>
wish’d for—and they would of course
readily <i>risk</i> their Wive’s Purity being contaminated,
rather than <i>be disappointed</i> in
the Pleasure of seducing the Wives <i>of their
acquaintance</i>, through the <i>preparatory</i> Assistance
of the <i>Men</i>-midwives. The Happiness
of our gay young Men <i>not</i> being
centered within the narrow Circle of
Home, <i>the Virtue</i> of their Wives is not
in the least essential, has no Weight, <i>when
ballanced</i> with <i>the Advantages</i> they derive
from the too <i>general</i> Prostitution of the
Sex. They <i>extract Balm</i> from <i>the Vices</i> of
<i>Other</i> Women, which has sovereign Efficacy
<i>in healing</i> any Wounds—<i>alleviating</i> any
smarts, which they may receive, or feel,
from the infidelity of <i>their own</i> Wives—whom
they never treated as their <i>rational
Companions</i>, whose Affections they were
desirous of fixing irremoveably,—but as
<i>necessary</i> Beings to do the Honours of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
their Tables—furnish Heirs—and save
their Estates from being encumbered with
the Payment of the Fortunes of their
younger Brothers and Sisters. The only
View on <i>one</i> side, is <i>Money</i>—on the <i>other</i>,
<i>Quality</i>—<i>each</i> having attain’d the <i>only</i> Object
<i>they aim’d at in Marriage</i>,—each, without
any fundamental Principle of Goodness,
to restrain their Pursuits within the
Bounds of Virtue, they throw off the
Mask of Decency—and riot in Vice!—Our
young Men think the Scriptures fit
only to impose on Weakness. The Injunctions
of the Gospel interfere with their
Enjoyments—and having never believed
it’s sacred Truths—or endeavoured to follow
it’s amiable Precepts, they never experienced
the serene Tranquillity arising
from the delightful Possession of an approving
Conscience. At the best, <i>forgetful</i>
even of the Existence of a God—and
laughing at the idle supposition of a
future state, they give the Reins without
Controul to all their Appetites and Passions—check’d
by nothing but what <i>they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
term <span class="smcap">honour</span></i>. But <i><span class="smcap">their</span> Honour</i> is comprised,
in—<i>punishing the Man with <span class="smcap">murder</span>
who dares to doubt</i> their veracity, or
fail in Respect to their Dignity—and in
paying their Debts <i>to <span class="smcap">sharpers</span></i>, instead
of rewarding the Industry of their Tradesmen,
by giving them—<i>their own Property</i>.
<i><span class="smcap">Their</span> Honour</i> does not restrain
them from defiling the Beds <i>of their
Friends</i>—<i><span class="smcap">breaking</span> Promises</i> to <i><span class="smcap">worthy</span>
Dependants</i>—or <i>betraying</i> the Interests and
Honour of their Country for <i>base Wages of
Iniquity</i>, though committed with Confidence
to their Charge, <i>yet sacrificed</i> without
Remorse, for their <i>private</i> Emolument.
<i><span class="smcap">Their</span> Honour</i> enforces <i>no single
Virtue</i>!—<span class="smcap">away with such honour!</span></p>

<p>I next consider’d the number of <i>well-disposed</i>
Men, who <i>through Prejudice</i> might
<i>neglect</i>; or through Indolence, or Weakness
of Understanding, be blind to the
Force of my Arguments, and of course
remain unconvinced by them—and these
Obstacles, united, appeared too formidable
to be surmounted by any weak Effort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
I could make through the Channel of a News
Paper. At last however I took Courage
and submitted my Sentiments to the Consideration
of the Public, in the Gazetteer
of the 28th of March.</p>

<p>I had not, at that time, any Intention
of writing another Letter,—but deriving
Hopes from the favourable Impression my
first seem’d to have made on the Minds of
the Considerate—and having heard weight
laid on <i>the Men’s Knowledge of Anatomy</i> as
a Reason why <i>they</i> should <i>be safer</i> than
Women, I wrote the second Letter to remove
<i>that specious</i>, but <i>mistaken</i> Idea—and
having <i>known</i> some, and heard of <i>many</i>
other young Men Midwives, who really
<i>are ignorant</i> of that Knowledge of Anatomy
which is <i>their only</i> Recommendation <i>to <span class="smcap">infatuated</span>
Husbands</i>;—and a Man Midwife,
under the Signature of “Old Chiron,”
having endeavoured to abuse the
World with the most scandalous misrepresentations,
and <i>gross Fallacies</i>, my last
Letter appeared to expose the Danger of
employing raw young Men—or believing
such <i>interested Deceivers</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>I am quite indifferent about the Offence
which my Letters have given <i>the Ladies of
Fashion</i>, and their <i>darling</i> Doctors—<i>their
“sweet Men.”</i> They are conscious my
Letters convey only <i>a very faint</i> Sketch of
their <i>immodest, obscene practices</i>. They are
<i>too bad</i> to be <i>exactly</i> described without
using Language very unfit for the Inspection
of virtuous Women!—I place dreadful
Rocks in their View, to warn them
from a Course on which their Purity
would be irretrievably wreck’d: and surely
those Parents entertain <i>strange</i> Notions
of <i>Virtue</i>, who carefully keep my Letters
out of the way of their Daughters, through
what <i>they imagine to be</i> “Delicacy!”—they
would rather, in short, have them <i>polluted
in future—past redemption</i>—than instructed
by my friendly Admonitions, how
to avoid the Path to Vice!—the modest,
amiable, worthy, <i>sensible</i> Part of the Community,
I am confident, will read my
Pamphlet with Candour—approve of the
Sentiments contain’d in it—and recommend
it to the Perusal of others. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
view the Censures, and Displeasure of <i>the
vicious</i>, and the <i>dissipated</i>, as the highest
Eulogiums;—as Praise—which will convey
<i>the most genial warmth</i> to my Heart—and,
I trust, afford me a pleasing Retrospect
in my <i>latest</i> Hours!—</p>

<p>My Letters having succeeded beyond
my most sanguine Expectation, I am now
encouraged to attack <i>another</i> prevailing
Custom among the Fair—that of <i>not</i> giving
suck to their Infants, at least during
the first five or six weeks.</p>

<p>I shall wave considering <i>the Propriety</i> of
a Mother’s giving suck through a Sense of
the <i>incumbent Duty</i> she <i>owes</i> her child.—Though
the Custom of backening the
Milk is <i>unnatural</i>, dangerous, and too often
<i>fatal</i>, I shall lay no stress on the former,
but rest it entirely on the latter—for
in <i>such</i> an Age as the present, in which
our fine Ladies have few Ideas of any Religion—are
not capable of receiving Pleasure
from <i>domestick</i> Employments—would
infinitely rather <span class="smcap">converse</span> with <i>any Men</i>
than their <i>Husbands</i>—leave their Children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
to be instructed, or <i>neglected</i> by Servants,
and fly abroad, with eager Impatience <i>to
game away</i> their Husbands Fortunes, and
receive the <i>criminal</i> Addresses of <i>their profligate</i>
Admirers, at the Assembly, the
Masquerade, or more <i>commodious Apartments</i>
of <i>the Coterie</i>—laughing at the Censures
of <i>the few</i> who have still some
Regard to Decorum—and despising the
Belief of the perpetual Presence of a
Being who is Witness to all their <i>secret
vicious Deformities</i>—in <i>such</i> times it would
be Folly to mention the Dangers they expose
their Infants to, from diseased Milk,
want of a tender Mother’s Care—or dream
of asking them how they will answer to
the Almighty for <i>not</i> having afforded them
the Nourishment He kindly provided for
their Support?—I shall therefore only
shew the Absurdity and <i>danger</i> of this
Custom, as far as it regards the Health
of <i>the Mother</i>.</p>

<p>And here I must endeavour to give my
Readers some Idea of that part of the human
Body which is concern’d in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
formation, and absorbtion of the Milk,
in order for their understanding the
Force of my arguments.</p>

<p>Our Bodies are constantly, when in
Health, receiving Repairs in all their
Parts, from millions of the smallest,
most minute Arteries. Every Solid, and
every Juice, is form’d out of, and secreted
from, Blood. Those noxious
Parts of the Blood which are not proper
for these different, <i>opposite</i> Uses, are thrown
off by insensible Perspiration. When,
through various Causes, that Perspiration
is obstructed, the acrid Matter which
ought to have gone off, is absorb’d by the
lymphatick Vessels, and returns into the
Blood—brings on Fevers, Gout, Rheumatism,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Lymphaticks, are numberless Vessels,
which pass through spungy Glands.
These fine Tubes have a vast number of
Valves, which prevent the Lymph, (or
Liquor) which runs through them from
going <i>a contrary</i> Direction from that intended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
for it. These fine Vessels are dispersed
over every Part of our Bodies. The
Point of a needle could not be applied to a
Spot, under the Skin, where the Mouth of a
lymphatic Vessel did not open to imbibe
whatever is put in contact with it. These
minute Branches run into other Branches,
so form larger Vessels, till at last they all
unite in a general Reservoir, where the
Lymph which they contained, mixes with
the Chyle, (the fine Part of our Food,
which is fit to be converted into Blood)
conducted there by the Lacteals, (the
Lacteals resemble the Lymphaticks—they
open into the Stomach, and Bowels—they
imbibe nothing but from <i>our Food</i>)
the Chyle, and Lymph, thus mix’d, run
up within the trunk of a large Vessel called
the thoracic Duct, on the inside of the
back Bone, which is incessantly emptying
it’s Liquor into a Vein under the left
Collar Bone, where it mixes with the
Blood, is immediately convey’d into the
vena Cava, which conducts it, with the
returning Blood from the rest of the Body,
(Lungs excepted) into the right Auricle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of the Heart—it thence is drove by the
contraction of the Auricle, into the right
Ventricle of the Heart—by it’s contraction,
into the Pulmonary Artery—from
thence through the whole Lungs, where
the Blood receives a Change from being
impregnated with something received from
the Air every Inspiration. The Blood
thus changed, is collected from the
Lungs into the Pulmonary Veins, and
conducted into the left Auricle of the
Heart; which drives it into the left Ventricle;
which forces it into a great Artery,
the Aorta—which rushes it over every
other Part of the Body.</p>

<p>The lymphatic Vessels prevent our
Blood depending <i>solely</i> on our Food for
supply, and by means of them we can
subsist some time merely on the Produce
of our own Bodies. All these lymphatic
Vessels are closely accompanied by Arteries—whose
Pulsations assist the motion of the
Lymph to it’s Reservoir:⸺Consequently
the quicker and stronger they beat, the
faster the Lymph is hurried into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Blood. Hence the Reason why Fevers
occasion so speedy a wasting of the Flesh—hence
Hectics bring on Consumptions—hence
People in Fevers can subsist long
with little Food,—The lymphaticks then
supplying the Blood too abundantly from
our own Juices.</p>

<p>The Author of Nature has ordered an
extraordinary Quantity of Blood to be prepared
for the Child’s Food. Arteries run
into the Glands of the Breasts, and in
passing through them, the Blood, by a
most wonderful Change, is converted into
Milk!⸺by a Change, which nothing
but Custom prevents our viewing as a
Miracle!</p>

<p>The admired Toast of the Town cannot
endure the Trouble of nursing. It
would confine her too much at home—it
has too vulgar an appearance—it is not
warranted by <i>the Example</i> of the first
Circle—the Milk must <i>therefore</i> be backen’d.—It
is denied Liberty to discharge
itself by the Out-lett Providence <i>intended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
for it</i>—the Child, whose Constitution <i>it
was calculated for</i>, is not suffered to have
it’s Due. What becomes of the Milk?</p>

<p>It is absorb’d by the lymphatic Vessels,
<i>contrary</i> to the <i>original</i> Intention of Nature—and
convey’d back into the Blood,
in the manner I have before described.—What
is the Consequence?—The blood
Vessels become <i>not only highly over-charged</i>
with Blood, but that Blood is thus rendered
of an improper Consistence. A Fever
ensues!—This Fever comes on when
the woman is <i>ill able to bear</i> it’s Shock!—<i>How
often</i> is this Fever <i>fatal</i>!</p>

<p>The most fortunate Circumstance that
can happen, is, when the Milk finds
<i><span class="smcap">another</span> out-lett</i>. Probably <i>otherwise</i>
there may be a formation of Matter
somewhere—there is danger <i>that</i> Matter
may fly to some capital Part.</p>

<p>If the Woman is young, healthy, strong,
it is most probable the Milk will <i>not</i> be absorb’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
<i>quick enough</i>. The Blood will <i>furnish</i>
Milk <i>faster</i> than the lymphatick Vessels
can imbibe it, and convey it back
again. The Breasts are painfully distended—they
inflame.</p>

<p><i>When too late</i>—it is then resolved they
shall be suck’d.</p>

<p>During the time of Pregnancy a small
quantity of Milk is lodged in the Milk
Vessels of the Breasts. This Milk, when
the nine Months are expired, is thick—clogs
the Vessels. If the Woman never
gave suck, the Pores through which the
Milk ought to issue to the Child, are not
open enough—they require therefore <i>to
be clear’d</i>, by the <i>old</i> Milk being suck’d
off, <i>the very day of the Delivery</i>, and to
empty the Milk Vessels of what must
otherwise clog them. Some woman ought
to suck this off therefore <i>as soon as possible</i>.
If the Child is put to the Breast <i>in
Twelve, or Sixteen Hours</i> after it’s Birth,
it will suck <i>greedily</i>—if delay’d three or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17a"></a>[17*]</span>
four Days, it is twenty to one the Child
will not attempt it for a long time.</p>

<p>When therefore <i>the Necessity</i> of the
Case has overcome every Resolution
form’d for the Woman’s <i>not</i> giving suck,
and her Child is put to her Breast, it is
in vain!—the Child will not touch the
Breast!—<i>other</i> Children—or women attempt
to ease the poor Woman of her
Load of Milk—this Resource likewise
fails! the thick Milk has clog’d the Vessels—the
N-pp-es, owing to the hard
Distension of the Breasts, has shrunk into
them—and, besides, their Pores have
never been open’d—never been clear’d—no
endeavours avail! the distress’d Woman,
after having been sadly fatigued,
exhausted, finds herself disappointed of
Relief!—dreadful Symptoms soon appear!
she <i>too probably</i> falls a sacrifice to a
ridiculous—senseless—not to say a sinful
deviation <i>from the Path of Nature</i>!—how
many fine young Women have lately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18a"></a>[18*]</span>
died—and go off every Year, from this
Cause!</p>

<p>But “<i>particular</i> Women have not Constitutions
strong enough to bear giving
suck. Certainly there are some Women
whom it might hurt.” Granted. Let
such particular Women give suck <i>only</i> for
the first <i>four</i>, <i>five</i> or <i>six Weeks</i>. If those
Women <i>then</i> really find themselves too delicate
for the <i>longer</i> continuance of such a
Drain, they then <i>may safely</i> by degrees
leave off giving suck—they have sufficiently
recover’d Strength to venture
throwing the Milk gently back into the
Blood. The most delicately form’d Woman
existing should <i>not</i> dream of suffering
a single Drop of the Milk which Nature
<i>intended for Evacuation</i>, to return into
the Blood, untill the Constitution is re-established—and
enabled to bear discharging
itself of the Superfluities, without
encountering the Dangers which <i>demonstrably</i>
attend a contrary Practice. If
a Woman is too delicate to bear <i>continuing
to suckle</i> her Infant, surely she is <i>too delicate</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19a"></a>[19*]</span>
to endure the flying in the Face of
Nature, and <i>risking</i> the Fever—if she is
healthy and strong, the more incumbent
her duty is, to nourish her Child—her
danger too equal. In <i>every</i> View, the salutary
Consequences attending Mothers
discharging their Duty to their Children
in this point, are so obvious, so glaring,
that <i>to me</i> it is matter of doubt whether
those who fail in it are most to be condemn’d
and despised for <i>their want of natural
Affection</i>—or pitied and ridiculed <i>for
their Folly</i>.</p>

<p>These are my Ideas on this interesting
Subject. Let those Women who <i>obstinately</i>
persevere in a Resolution to deny
their Infants their natural Food—(and in
whose Judgements my Arguments have
appear’d deficient in Weight) stand the
Trial, and risk the Consequence. I most
sincerely hope the Success may answer
their Wishes!</p>

<p>I now refer my Readers to the following
Letters. I can assert, <i>with conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20a"></a>[20*]</span>
Truth</i> that my Sentiments on the <i>preceding</i>,
and <i>following</i> Subjects, have been the
offspring of an Heart warm’d by a Love
for my fellow-Creatures—ever most ardently
solicitous for their Welfare and
Happiness, here and hereafter.</p>

<p>I cannot expect <i>to reclaim</i> any Woman
who has <i>already used</i> a <i>Man</i>, for Reasons
I gave at the beginning of this Introduction,
and because, by quitting him, she
would <i>tacitly</i> acknowledge the Truth of
my Assertions—and because none but
those possess’d of the most exalted Qualities
of the Head and Heart, can have
<i>greatness</i> enough <i>to confess</i> they have been
in an Error of <i>such</i> a Nature.</p>

<p>I am not without hopes however, of
<i>opening the Eyes</i> of <i>sensible</i> Men—and unmarried
Women, who are <i>at present</i> modest,
and <i>wish</i> to <i>remain so</i>—and preventing
the <i>former from advising</i>, and the <i>latter
from falling into</i> the scandalous Custom
of employing <i>Men</i>-Midwifes, which <i>I
know</i> to be <i><span class="smcap">erroneous</span> as to it’s <span class="smcap">pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21a"></a>[21*]</span>
safety</span></i>—<i><span class="smcap">fatally</span> dangerous</i> to the <span class="smcap">virtue</span>—and
<i><span class="smcap">certainly</span> destructive</i> of the
<span class="smcap">modesty</span><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of my fair Countrywomen.—They
may believe me when I assure
them that <span class="smcap">no purity</span> can withstand the

<h1><span class="smaller">THE</span><br />
Danger and Immodesty, <i>&amp;c.</i></h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_I">LETTER I.</h2>

</div>

<p>In times, when every winter brings
scenes of prostitution from the privacy of
darkness into the public light of day; when
our ladies of quality, and women of fashion,
instead of being as remarkable for their
virtue, as for their beauty, openly cast
aside every sense of shame, and barefacedly
encourage the addresses of men, who,
avowedly, can have no intention but to
involve them in guilt; it is the duty of
every honest man to endeavour to trace the
evil <i>to its source</i>, in order that, by pointing
out <i>the foul spring</i> which corrupts the
stream, <i>the fountain may be cleared</i>, and
the contagion which rages from it, lessened,
if not entirely removed.</p>

<p>Boarding schools are, beyond doubt, seminaries,
where the minds of girls are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
early polluted. Let the mistress of the
school be ever so virtuous, prudent, and attentive,
the vicious girls (and some such there
always must be among a number) will find
sufficient opportunities to taint the tender
minds of unsuspecting innocence. Nothing
can be more destructive than bad example;
and, unfortunately, the human
mind is too ready to copy those which are
vicious—and <i>the vicious</i> are more importunate
and solicitous <i>to corrupt</i>, than <i>the virtuous</i>
are to gain proselytes to goodness.</p>

<p>Though I believe <i>the first seeds of vice</i>
are imbibed at a boarding school, yet
I <i>by no means</i> look on that education as the
great cause of these frequent adulteries. If
principles of virtue have been inculcated in
infancy, they may yet, with proper care,
bud out afresh under good culture—and
flourish under the influence of good advice,
when those noxious weeds are choaked up,
which were planted by bad examples, but
which may wither on the cause being removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p><i>It is to the almost universal custom of <span class="smcap">employing
Men-midwives</span>, that I attribute
the frequent <span class="smcap">adulteries</span> which disgrace
our country.</i></p>

<p><i>Ignorance</i> has spread this <i>shameless</i> custom.
Ignorance leads people to suppose
men <i>safer</i> than women—Ignorance of <i>what</i>
the <i>Men</i>-midwives <i>do</i>, leads modest women
<i>at first</i> to submit to employ men; and
<i>it is ignorance</i> which leads husbands [who
love their wives] to recommend, nay even
sometimes force them on their wives.
They know not what stripes they are
preparing for themselves—they know
not that they are removing the corner stone
on which the virtue of their wives
is founded—and all this on <i>a mistaken</i>
principle—<i>the idea that men are
safest</i>.</p>

<p>The Almighty, through kindness to his
creatures, has so ordered the labours of
women, that even the honest part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Men-midwife tribe confess, that, in thirty
years practice, a person might probably
never meet <i>with a single case</i> where a good
woman might not have done the business.
This confession was made to me by an eminent
man-midwife, after a practice of
thirty-six years. How else would the
world have been peopled? The men have
<i>but lately</i> come into fashion. In praise of
<i>Scotland</i> and <i>Ireland</i> be it spoken, <i>the women
of those countries are still too modest to
employ them</i>. What is the consequence?
<i>Adulteries</i> happen <i>very seldom in those countries</i>;
and every farm-house swarms with
strong, healthy, <i>well-limbed</i> children. If
Men-midwives were requisite to bring children
into the world, what would become
of the wilds of America—the plains of
Africa? Even the <i>Hottentot women</i> are too
modest to employ men—they leave that
abandoned custom <i>to our English ladies</i>—yet
they are so fruitful they furnish slaves
to the globe. It is a notorious fact, that
more children have been lost since women
were so scandalously indecent as to employ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
men, than for ages before that practice became
so general. Women have <i>a tenderness
of feeling for their own sex</i> in labour,
which <i>it is impossible men can ever equal
them in</i>. By <i>having felt</i> the pains, and
the anxieties attending child-birth, they
know how to sympathize in a woman’s
sufferings. <i>Their</i> feelings, therefore, are
<i>natural</i>. They lead them to be patient—they
prompt them <i>to allow nature to do her
own</i> peculiar work. They never dream of
having recourse to force—the <i>barbarous,
bloody crotchet</i> never stained <i>their</i> hands
with <i>murder</i>. There <i>never really</i> can be
occasion for a male operator, but when a
deed must be done which my soul shudders
at the idea of, and which I shall not
mention—but thanks to God, such instances
do not occur in a century!—To my
knowledge, a lady was twice delivered in
different parts of the country of England,
by common women-midwives, and both
those cases were <i>as unnatural</i> and difficult
as it is well possible to imagine—she and
the children did well—if she had employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
men, it is more than probable, <i>the children,
at least</i>, would have expired under
the crotchet—or been maimed by the forceps!</p>

<p>And how should this be otherwise! a
long <i>un-impassioned</i> practice, <i>early</i> commenced,
and <i>calmly</i> pursued, is absolutely
requisite to give men <i>by art</i>, what women
attain <i>by nature</i>.—Dr. Hunter, very wisely,
very justly has said, that “Labour is nature’s
work.”—Nature <i>ought to be suffered</i>
nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of
a thousand, <i>to do her own work</i>. All the
knowledge <i>young</i> men can possibly obtain,
must be from <i>dead</i> bodies—for is it in common
sense to suppose, that a young lad
can explore the secret recesses of Venus, so
as to be <i>physically</i> well acquainted with
those parts in <i>living</i> females? No—fires
must quickly be raised, which unavoidably
will confuse all his discerning <i>reasoning</i>
faculties—and <i><span class="smcap">art</span> must instantly be lost in
<span class="smcap">nature</span></i>. Dr. Hunter, indeed, and one
or two men besides, <i>may perhaps</i>, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
help of <i>cold</i> constitutions, and dint of very
long practice, do their business <i>nearly as
well</i> as women—by leaving all <i>to nature</i>—but,
if my life and fortune here, and salvation
hereafter, depended on the life
of any pregnant woman, and that of her
infant, I would stake all I held valuable on
her being attended by any old woman
midwife in England, in preference to any
man in the world. Whoever reads Nihel’s
Midwifery, will be satisfied of this truth,
that <i>women are infinitely safer than men</i>.</p>

<p>Who can wonder at the profligacy of
the times, when it is known that even
women of character soon become so callous
to the bashfulness which ought to
characterize their sex (from being habituated
to the familiarities of their Men-midwives)
that they will not scruple informing
a male visitor, without even blushing,
“I was not very well for some days in the
country—so I came to town on purpose to
be satisfied by Dr. ⸺ that I was in
a good way—<i>the dear man</i> has told me that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
<i>the child lies right</i>—and I am perfectly easy.”
Monstrous! that a lady can pretend to any
degree of modesty, and yet, <i>not content</i>
with having <i>a strange</i> man attending her
<i>for hours</i> when in labour (most of that time
intimately acquainted with <i>every</i> part) she
can, without any compunction, send for
a man, and admit him without reserve
<i>to the most unbounded</i> liberties, at a
time too, when she is <i>as able</i> to walk, and
<i>do every other act</i> of life, as if she was not
pregnant! Pray let me ask her ladyship,
<i>how</i> did “<i>The dear man</i>,”—“<i>sweet Dr.
⸺</i>,” <i>find out</i> how the child lay?—By
means <i>sufficient to taint the purity</i>, and <i>fully
the chastity</i>, of any woman breathing!—I
will boldly affirm, that, whoever admits
a man to those <i>licentious</i> freedoms, cannot
pretend to answer for what <i>may</i> be the consequences.
If <i>the last</i> circumstance does
not take place, it must be owing, either to
an extraordinary insensibility in the man,
or to the woman’s not suiting his taste,
having such choice of beauties to visit. Suppose,
for argument’s sake, that the fictitious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Goddess of Chastity, Diana herself, was
on earth, and employed me to satisfy
her doubts, during the months of pregnancy
prior to labour—and her mind
of course, at first, free from the smallest
tincture of guilty ideas—yet, if I chose it,
I could <i>so bewilder her reason</i>, that she
should <i>lose sight of every principle of virtue</i>—and
not <i>be able</i> to refuse me whatever I
chose to desire.—When a man is in free
possession of the Citadel, and all the out-works
surrendered at discretion, it is then
too late to attempt guarding the town from
plunder.</p>

<p>But supposing these advantages are not
always taken (<i>which I dare say they are
not</i>) it cannot be denied <i>with truth</i> these
visitations from Men-midwives, remove in
a great measure, the horror of those intrusions
on the advanced posts of virtue,
which are its greatest safeguards—and serve
<i>to prepare the way</i> for the addresses of gay
young men, who make it their business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to seduce married women into the paths of
infamy.</p>

<p>If any lady, desirous of exculpating herself
from my censure, pleads that “she
never admits a Man-midwife <i>to familiarities</i>
but when <i>in actual labour</i>”—I answer,
that, even <i>in actual</i> labour—<i>a woman has
many intervals of ease</i>, for many minutes
together quite free from pain—<i>in those intervals</i>,
her mind <i>cannot</i> maintain <i>its spotless
whiteness</i>—<i>in those</i> intervals she cannot
but <i>be conscious</i>, that the <i><span class="smcap">doctor</span> is infringing
on the <span class="smcap">husband</span></i>.</p>

<p>But I believe there are very few women
who confine the Doctor’s familiarities to
the times of real labour. Lady ⸺, Mrs.
⸺, acquiesce in whatever he thinks
right during all the months of pregnancy—and
must he not be <i><span class="smcap">more</span> than man</i>, or
<span class="smcap">less than man</span>, who, <i>roving luxuriously</i>
through all the <i>hidden</i> charms of beauty,
can help being inflamed by passion?—and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
<i>if inflamed by passion</i>, he may proceed <span class="smcap">on
certainties</span> ... he has an <i><span class="smcap">unerring</span>
tell-tale under his inspection</i>, which gives
him <i>an <span class="smcap">infallible</span> cue, when he may
safely</i> throw aside the mask, fearless of any
repulse.</p>

<p>Shew some sense of modesty, ye
Duchesses, Countesses, &amp;c. &amp;c. and those
inferior women, whom <i>ye have debauched</i>
by your bad examples, will again imitate
ye, in forsaking these Scandalous practices.
Blush, ye women of fashion, to own that
any man, besides your husbands, <i>is admitted
to liberties with your persons</i>. No longer
talk of “<i>dear</i> Doctor Hunter,” “<i>angelic</i>
Doctor—” “<i>enchanting</i> Doctor—.” ...
For my own part, if I was a married man,
I declare it would be <i>a matter of the utmost
indifference</i> to me, whether my wife
had spent the night <i>in a bagnio</i>—or an
hour of the forenoon locked up with a
man-midwife in her dressing room.—Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
this <i>shameless</i> custom be abolished, and
then virtue will fly back again to our metropolis,
with all her train of <i>genuine self-approving
pleasures</i>—and England be <i>once
more</i> as much famed for the chastity, as
for the beauty of its women.</p>

<p>Adieu, Mr. Printer—you have received
this letter from a sincere admirer of female
modesty: Without it “beauty
<i>ceases being lovely</i>, or wit being engaging.”
Whoever possesses it cannot be enough
esteemed and regarded—whoever is deficient
in it cannot be sufficiently despised
and slighted. Ye <i>English</i> fair, <i>it ought</i> to
be your characteristic! <i>but while your fathers,
husbands, and brothers are unprincipled,
corrupted senators</i>—you think you
have a right to deviate from <i>your point of
honour</i>, since <i>they shew you the example in
their’s</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>To conclude—<i>true modesty is incompatible
with the idea of employing</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_II">LETTER II.</h2>

</div>

<p>The favourable reception my last letter
met with from the public, leads
me to hope our married men will seriously
reflect on the dangers which attend the
employing Men-midwives to attend their
wives, except in cases where there is the
most urgent necessity for the interference
of art. I flatter myself it will not be difficult
to convince <i>sensible</i>, <i>modest</i> women
of two undeniable truths, which nothing
but prejudice, or vice, can render them
blind to the force of:—First, that Men-midwives
are not so safe as women;—and
secondly, that it is absolutely impossible to
permit men to take the unbounded freedoms
which Men-midwives <i>falsely pretend are
necessary</i>, without throwing themselves entirely
at their mercy, and, at all events,
being polluted by their needless invasion.</p>

<p>The Men-midwives and their friends, have
wisely chose to be silent. They are conscious
my assertions cannot be denied with any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
shadow of truth, they therefore prudently
have declined the combat. If they had attempted
controverting my arguments, they
must have discovered the sandy foundations
on which they have established the idea of
<i>their being the proper</i> attendants on the labours
of women. Objections which they
cannot remove,—dangers which they cannot
dissipate,—and impurities which no
varnish can conceal, they wish to avoid
mentioning; fearful lest an attempt to answer
my letter, should display to the world
the weakness and insufficiency of their defence,
and stimulate abler pens than mine
to continue the subject too long for their
interest. They vainly imagine my letter
will soon be forgotten, and be consigned
to oblivion amongst waste paper. But
they are mistaken,—this letter shall accompany
it annually to the press, to remind
my fair countrywomen of the inestimable
value of chastity,—and to warn
them from those practices which pave the
way to the most flagrant breach of it;—and
I am not without hope that I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
joined by the friends of virtue, and assisted
in the arduous talk I have undertaken.
What undertaking can be more difficult to
succeed in, than an endeavour to reform
the manners of a vicious age? Yet, encouraged
by the consciousness of the rectitude
of my intentions, and of the sincerity
of my wishes to repair the foundations
of matrimonial happiness, I freely offer
my sentiments to the world,—let the candid
weigh them in the scale of common-sense,—and
either adopt, or disregard them,
as they appear to tend to the benefit, or
prejudice of mankind. The consequence
of their decision will principally affect
themselves,—it will not reach to me.</p>

<p>The Men-midwives are sensible, that,
when they urge their knowledge in anatomy
as a reason for their being safer than
women, they mean to take advantage of
<i>the ignorance</i> of mankind. Where <i>very
rare</i>, <i>particular</i> circumstances occur, undoubtedly
the knowledge of anatomy becomes
then absolutely necessary to direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the operator in the means requisite to save
the woman’s life. In that distressed, unhappy,
deplorable situation, no modesty
can possibly be violated. The poor afflicted
woman, is, <i>if sensible</i>, so taken up
with anxious thoughts, and torturing
pains, that she is <i>not conscious</i> of the transaction—and
the Royal Exchange, when
crouded, might be spectators, without attracting
her attention, or interrupting her
fears. It is quite different in <i>a very large
majority</i> of labours. The woman has
many intervals of ease,—she does not apprehend
there is any peculiar danger in
her case:—her mind, while free from
pain, is at liberty calmly to attend to
whatever is done. There is not above one
labour in a thousand where there is any
occasion for the knowledge of anatomy.
I insist that <i>except in those very extraordinary
cases</i>, a knowledge of anatomy leads Men-midwives
frequently to do great mischief.
<i>It makes them impatient.</i> They <i>know how</i>
to bring on the labour pains,—they <i>know
how to force the birth</i>. From <i>this <span class="smcap">destructive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
knowledge</span></i>, numbers of children
are demolished,—numbers of women
are thrown into fevers by <i>lacerations</i> and
<i>inflammations</i>, which might have the worst
consequences, and which never would
have happened <i>if the knowledge of anatomy</i>
had not <i>tempted men</i> to have recourse <i>to
<span class="smcap">art</span> within the proper boundaries of <span class="smcap">nature’s</span>
empire</i>. For this reason, if I was
a married man, I would not employ <i>even
a woman</i> who had been bred under a Man-midwife.
Her <i>knowing the parts <span class="smcap">anatomically</span></i>,
and <i>understanding the <span class="smcap">use</span> of
<span class="smcap">instruments</span></i>, and pursuing the <i>teizing</i>,
<i>fiddling</i> customs of the men who had instructed
her, instead of recommending her
to me, would be a sufficient cause to prevent
my employing her.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">The only safe knowledge</span> for a midwife
to possess</i>, is, <i>that which is taught by
<span class="smcap">experience</span></i>. Whenever it <i>ceases</i> being
possible for nature, with such assistance,
to do her work, <i>then</i>, and <i>then only</i>, art
ought to be called in with instruments to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
aid.—Yet our young women are not ashamed
<i>premeditately to resolve</i> on employing
men, though there are such a multitude
of chances <i>against</i> the supposition of a dead
child—or that there will be occasion for
the destruction of her infant to save her
own life. It is for this wanton use of men,
that I wish I had abilities to expose their
want of modesty in colours striking enough
to hold out our women to the universal ridicule
of the world, and draw down on
them the contempt and indignation of the
virtuous.</p>

<p>Is it not laughable to hear of a <i>modest</i>
woman sending for <i>a man</i> to inform her
<i>whether or not she is with child</i>, and <i>how
far gone</i>?—Heavens! <i>a little patience</i>
would soon have cleared up that matter,
and the most skilful man may be mistaken,
<i>even allowing the supposition</i> (which is <i><span class="smcap">not</span>
probable</i>) <span class="smcap">that he may be quite cool</span>,
and <i>experience <span class="smcap">no fluttering</span> sensations
to confuse his mind during <span class="smcap">the serious</span> investigation</i>.
Why cannot the lady <i>allow a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
few months</i> to elapse? Her doubts would
then have been removed, without any <i>male</i>
intrusions, <i>without <span class="smcap">scandalous violations</span>
of <span class="smcap">modesty</span></i>—without, what I
term, <span class="smcap">shameful pollutions of her
person</span>.</p>

<p>What must Men-midwives think of those
ladies, who send for them to be inspected
on such trifling occasions? <i>What can they
avoid thinking?</i> Must they not conclude,
that those ladies are restrained from adultery
<i><span class="smcap">not</span> by any principle</i> of virtue, but by
a dread of the consequences; and, since
they can admit no man to familiarities but
their Man-midwife (who is the <i>priviledged
father confessor of England</i>) without losing
their reputations, they are resolved to be
<i>as immodest</i>, without losing their characters,
as the depraved, profligate custom of the
world can authorize them? Men-midwives
entertain each other with curious recitals
of their adventures among the fair:—Surely
those women cannot justly be pitied, who
thus by their folly, or vice, furnish subjects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
<i>first</i> for their sensual <i>ideas</i>, and <i>afterwards</i>
for their mirth.</p>

<p>I have been a good deal amused by hearing
my letter commented on in different
companies, where the author was far from
being suspected to be present. The Men-midwives,
and the ladies who receive
pleasure from employing them, never can
forgive me for having exposed their conduct.
All they can however say against
me, is, that I am “<i>very indelicate</i>;”—that
“<i>it is a shame such papers should appear</i>.”—Let
them be informed, Mr. Printer,
that <span class="smcap">if I am “indelicate,”</span> it is
<i>because <span class="smcap">they are immodest</span></i>. Where
<i>the bone</i> is <i>corrupted</i>, the flesh must be removed,
and <i>the foul parts laid bare</i>, in order
to be <i>scraped</i>, and <i>purified</i>—<i>desperate
disorders require desperate remedies</i>. <i>The
“shame” does not consist <span class="smcap">in what I write</span>
but <span class="smcap">in what they do</span></i>.—<i>Let them <span class="smcap">quit
their practice</span>, I will most readily throw
aside my pen.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>I should be sorry to entertain so bad an
opinion of the generality of my fair countrywomen,
as to suppose them hardened
by the depraved custom of the times, beyond
a possibility of being roused to a sense
of danger for themselves and infants, and
to a sense of virtue. Doctor Hunter is,
beyond dispute, <i>the best Man</i>-midwife in
the world—yet, let the advocates for the
<i>indiscriminate</i> use of men lay their hands on
their hearts, and answer me ingenuously
this question—Suppose any <i>three</i> of the
<i>best</i> Midwives in London had lost <i>in their
lives, the same number</i> of women of fashion
<i>Doctor Hunter</i> has lost <i>within these two or
three years</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> would they not have exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
loudly, and <i>taken advantage</i> of those
deaths <i>to prove the danger of employing women</i>?
All England would have rung of
their mismanagement—and the women
would have been ruined!—There are women
in London who have laid several thousands,
and yet never lost either a mother
or an infant.</p>

<p>Though the abandoned custom exculpates
ladies in the estimation of a dissipated
world, yet I recommend to their confederation
<i>how their thoughts, during the visits</i>
of Men-midwives, will stand the test of the
penetrating eye of their Creator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>I hope to live to see the day, when innate
modesty will be the characteristic of
English women; and <i>of course</i>, when a lady
will not be more publickly branded with
infamy for the most barefaced prostitution,
than for the effrontery which <i>will then</i> be
necessary to enable a woman wantonly to
employ</p>

<p class="right">A MAN-MIDWIFE.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> I would by no means be understood to insinuate
the most distant reflection on Dr. Hunter’s management.
I have not the smallest idea that any of those
deaths were in consequence of the least fault in his execution
of his business. I only mentioned them to shew
that misfortunes <i>may happen</i> with the most able Man-midwife;
and therefore that it is cruel to name one or two
accidents as proof of a woman’s being unsafe, since they
will happen to the first man in the whole world. I look
on Dr. Hunter as a most skilful anatomist; able physician;
experienced, tender, patient Man-midwife. If
it was left to me to call any man to the labour of a woman
in imminent danger, and whose life was linked in
mine, Dr. Hunter is the man I would send for without
a moment’s hesitation, his skill, but, above all, his
experience, <span class="smcap">age</span>, and <span class="smcap">infirmities</span>, render him the
<span class="smcap">only</span> man proper to be allowed <i>to take liberties</i> with
married women. Yet <i>any woman of experience</i>, in my
opinion, is <i>infinitely safer</i> than even Dr. Hunter, <i>except
in very extraordinary cases</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_III">LETTER III.</h2>

</div>

<p>In my two last letters, I believe I satisfied
those <i>who are open to conviction</i>, that
<i>even the best</i> Men-midwives are <i>not so safe</i>
as women,—and that the custom is destructive
of modesty, and affords those
Men-midwives <i>who chuse it</i>, finer seraglios
than are in the possession of the most luxuriant
Monarchs of the East.</p>

<p>There are bad consequences attending
the practice which I have not mentioned.
It is productive of danger, and of many
evils, even when followed by the most eminent
men in London;—who can fix limits
then to its pernicious consequences, when
a set of <i>raw, unskillful young</i> men are turned
loose through this town—round its
skirts—and over the whole kingdom, and
are received by the credulous multitude
with no other recommendation than the
words over the door of “⸺, <i>Surgeon and
Man-midwife</i>?” Boys think themselves
qualified for Men-midwives, by having attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
one or two courses of lectures under
Doctor Hunter,—or, perhaps, without
having heard any lectures at all, or ever
having seen a subject anatomized, start
from behind an apothecary’s counter—and
begin their career, murdering of infants
without mercy; and with impunity laying
the foundation for cancers, and the most
dreadful diseases in women;—not to mention
the chance of their ruining the peace
of families, by introducing vice and discord,
where health and harmony might
otherwise have gladdened their serene dwellings.—They
know enough of the ways
requisite to use force;⸺they have heard
female Midwives blamed for allowing tedious
labours;⸺they think they will be
deemed expert, in proportion <i>to the quickness</i>
with which they bring the child into
the world,—and the mischiefs they of course
give rise to are innumerable! It is not in
the nature of things possible that <i>a young
man</i>, ever so well qualified <i>by study</i>, can be
<i>a safe</i> Midwife—how dreadful then must
the situations be of those poor women who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
are in the hands of the numberless men
who practice that business throughout England!⸺The
people ignorantly take for
granted <i><span class="smcap">that the sex</span> constitutes knowledge—insures
safety</i>! The truth is, <i><span class="smcap">the
sex</span> alone is sufficient</i> to render <span class="smcap">any knowledge</span>
destructive in <i>general</i> practice. If
the men <i>must be introduced</i> into <i>the privacies</i>
of women, I would earnestly recommend
it as <i><span class="smcap">the most essential</span> qualification</i>
requisite <span class="smcap">to prepare</span> them for the
study, that they submit to having their
<i><span class="smcap">voices</span> made delicate</i>.</p>

<p>And here I should have finished my letter,
and the subject, if I had not seen an
Essay in the Gazetteer of the 17th, signed
“Old Chiron,” which I cannot avoid making
some remarks on, before I conclude.</p>

<p>The author of it uses tolerable language,
and probably could write pretty well on
any other subject. He has done as much
as could have been attempted in order <i>to
continue</i> the delusive error which blinds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
mankind. He knew he had <i>not Truth</i> on
his side—he has therefore <i>put words together,
without argument</i>⸺he has boldly denied,
what it is impossible to disprove⸺he has
<i>as</i> boldly <i>asserted <span class="smcap">what never happened</span></i>—and
then <i>laughed-off</i> facts, trusting
<i>by ridicule</i> to conceal their existence.
The pen of <i>Junius</i> could not defend the
women who use men.</p>

<p>I believe <i>the thinking</i> part of the world
will join with me in opinion, that he would
have shewn more wisdom if he had remained
silent. A bad defence does harm
to any cause—and <i>the more able</i> the defender
appears in his stile and language, the
worse it is for his cause when he convinces
his readers, that even <i>his abilities</i> cannot do
it service. The more this subject is investigated,
the more prejudicial it will be
to his profession.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A practice, <i>adopted</i>, and
<i>continued through a jumblement</i> of <span class="smcap">ignorance</span>
and <span class="smcap">vice</span>, can only be favoured by
suffering <i>an impenetrable</i> shade <i>to veil</i> actions
<i>fit only for darkness</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Old Chiron has been drove so hard as
to have been forced to assert that the female
Midwives always “<i>cram</i> their patients
with cordials⸺<i>keeping them intoxicated
during the time they are in labour</i>”—and
that they act like infernal fiends, “<i>driving</i>
poor women <i>up and down stairs, notwithstanding
their <span class="smcap">shrieks</span></i>, and <i>shaking them
so violently</i> as often to bring on convulsion
fits, on pretence of hastening their
labours⸺laughing at their cries⸺and
breaking wretched jests upon the
contortions of the women, whose torments
would make a feeling man shudder
at the sight.”⸺I believe that
it is not possible any one can be <i>so sillily credulous</i>
as to have faith in these most <i>shocking,
unnatural, improbable, horrid</i> recitals!
Is it possible even <i>if such a brute</i> in an human
shame found an entry into an house,
that the poor lying-in woman could <i>be able</i>
to be forced “<i>up and down stairs</i>?”⸺and
<i>allow herself</i> to be <i>shook</i>? If <i>she</i> was ignorant
enough, and foolish enough to consent,
<i>would her relations</i>⸺<i>her friends</i>⸺anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
attending her, <i>likewise be so ignorant</i>
as not to know <i>such</i> treatment was highly
improper, as well as <i>cruel beyond cannibal
brutality</i>? And this too <i>in England</i>!
where bearing of children is not so very <i>uncommon</i>,
so very <i>extraordinary</i> a circumstance,
as that a Midwife could find means
to persuade people into such dreadful absurdities!—The
idea <i>is too ridiculous</i>! I have
seen among my near relations, many women
in labour, as long as it was decent for
a man to be present; and declare I have
always seen their Midwives treat them with
the utmost tenderness. I have enquired
of several ladies of my acquaintance, each
of whom has bore many children, and always
employed women, and they have all
declared they never even <i>heard</i> of any thing
in the <i>most distant</i> manner resembling such
treatment, as this <i>interested</i> author has abused
his talents by relating. To vouch
falsehoods, and for <i>the most malignant</i> purposes,
needs no comment. Perhaps some
diabolical wretch may have behaved in this
manner⸺but is that ground enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
erect defamations on, against the whole
sex? If <i>such</i> proof was to be admitted decisive,
I could severely retaliate on him
<i>such</i> proceedings of men, as would melt
an heart of adamant! and I could bring
demonstrable evidence to confirm the authenticity
of my relations—but I have already
been called “<i>indelicate</i>”—and if I
was to write the horrors my pen could unfold—delineate
facts, painting <i>the indecencies</i>,
and <i>barbarities</i> of men <i>whom I could
name</i>, I should <i>indeed be indelicate</i>. What
must then the <i><span class="smcap">acts</span> have been, which <span class="smcap">no
language</span> can convey a description of,
without offending the virtuous</i>, and <i>shocking</i>
the <i>humane</i>! yet I should look on myself
as very culpable if I had instanced these
men <i>as standards</i> for the whole profession
to be judged by. I gave the preference <i>to
women, <span class="smcap">not</span> because all men <span class="smcap">were brutes</span></i>,
but because <i>the greatest Saint</i> on earth, <i><span class="smcap">if</span> a
<span class="smcap">man</span> in health</i>, could not answer for his
principles being proof against the <i>irresistible
temptations arising</i> from being <i>freely indulged</i>
in <i>the most luxurious</i> liberties with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
<i>the feminine</i> beauties of lovely women,—and
because their knowledge of anatomy,
and their <i><span class="smcap">instruments</span> being ready at
hand</i>, too often <i>tempt</i> them to use <i>force</i>,
and do mischief in parts of the most <i>exquisite</i>
sensibility, which <i>no</i> art, <i>no</i> care, <i>no</i>
remedy, can <i>ever</i> after repair; where, if
<i>nature</i> had been allowed to do her office,
she would have been <i>a safe</i> operator, and
all would have ended happily; and let any
impartial person decide <i>whether a man</i>, who
knows every method of forcing the birth,
<i>or a woman</i>, who is conscious of being <i>unacquainted</i>
with <span class="smcap">that dangerous knowledge</span>,
<i>are <span class="smcap">most likely</span> to alter the
<span class="smcap">course of nature</span>, by interfering</i>, where
she ought to be <span class="smcap">the sole</span> actor?⸺It
is an indisputable fact, that women have
such a peculiar sympathy for females big
with young, that ninety-nine out of an
hundred carry it to such an excess as to be
anxious about <i>brutes</i> in that situation. I
have often heard ladies uneasy about mares
they have seen with foal, and bitches with
whelp. It is <i>an instinct</i> implanted, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
interwoven with their natures <i>by the Great
Source</i> of all things, for the wisest purposes.
Those <i>who have felt</i> the agonies of
child birth, surely must be able to sympathize
<i>more feelingly</i> than men who can only
form an idea of them by theory. Women
must be allowed to have more tenderness
in their natures than men⸺so that <i>in
every view</i> we cannot contest the point of
sensibility with them. Yet this author asserts
women are improper for Midwives
because they are <i>most</i> inhuman—because
they drive their fellow-creatures up and
down stairs—and shake them into convulsion
fits! did old Chiron write ironically?
or did he mean to betray the cause of
the male-practitioners, by asserting fictitious
nonsense, which carries falsehood on
it’s face?⸺Let any one <i>view the forceps</i>,
and then judge <i>whether</i> it is <i>a <span class="smcap">gentle instrument</span>?
it speaks it’s office!</i>—Let any
one <i>view the crotchet</i>, crooked scissars, &amp;c.
sharp knives to be sure are instruments fit
to be trusted in every hand! they pursue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
<i>healing</i> measures! they never commit <i>murder</i>!</p>

<p>The writer was pleased to confine himself
to what I said of the Hottentot women,
because the heat of their climate was
adapted to his purpose. I mentioned likewise
“the wilds of America,” and the
kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland. I
fancy those countries are cold enough in
winter.</p>

<p>He has quoted the practice of the Athenians
as an example for our women.
Though <i>Heathen virtues</i> are great reproaches
<i>on Christian vices</i> (I should have
said, on the vices of people who are only
<i>Christians in name</i>, by outwardly professing
what their lives are daily contradicting) yet
I should imagine <i>no Heathen impurities</i> ought
to be admitted patterns against Christian
virtues.—Our surgeons are better anatomists
than the Athenians were; but I am
afraid the Athenian men were better Christians,
though they lived before the birth
of our Saviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“But the women of quality <i>do so fall in
love</i> with their Doctors.”—I beg he will
excuse me,—I <i>never</i> supposed they <span class="smcap">fell
in love</span> with <span class="smcap">their male inspector</span>.
<i>The sensations</i> which <i>Men-midwives</i> give rise
to, <i>deserve not</i> the name which distinguishes
<i>that <span class="smcap">noble</span> passion <span class="smcap">of the soul</span></i>.—<i><span class="smcap">Love</span>,
allies us to our Divine Original, elevates
our ideas to Heaven, and makes us emulous of
worthy actions</i>! It’s signification is <i>scandalously
perverted</i>, when used to describe <i>the
impure</i> gratifications of sense, which degrade
us <i>below the brutes</i>!—<i>Love</i>, and <i>Virtue</i>,
are <i>inseparable</i>. Love never inspires
the human heart, but when <i>that heart is
in pursuit of virtue</i>; when <i>vicious</i> purposes
<i>pollute</i> the mind, <i>it’s end</i> is <i>lust</i>.</p>

<p>“Has there ever been related an instance
of so unnatural a connexion?” <i>Many</i>
where <i>it has been attempted</i>—<i>several</i> where
it has <i>succeeded</i>. Any person may buy the
trial of Doctor Morley, where they will
see that he was <i>convicted</i>, and <i>fined a thousand
pounds</i>, for seducing Mrs. Biker. The
poor woman accused the Doctor on her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
death-bed, and told the whole transaction.
The Doctor pleaded to his friends “<i>the
strength of the temptation, the frailty of
nature</i>; and the impossibility of any man’s
<i>resisting such powerful charms</i>.” He quitted
his business; <i>the ladies</i>, however, <i>approved
his conduct</i>,—it <i><span class="smcap">recommended</span> him <span class="smcap">to
their favour</span></i>, and <i>he was more employed
than ever</i>! Doctor ⸺ was forced to
feign madness to escape the rage of an injured
husband, for having frightened his
wife to death! She happened to be <i>a virtuous</i>,
though <i><span class="smcap">not</span> a <span class="smcap">modest</span></i>, woman!—Count
<span class="smcap">Struenzy</span> too was a Man-midwife.—Would
he ever have dared to lift
his eye, or breathe his infamous passion
to a ⸺, if he had not been encouraged
and <i>familiarized</i> by the freedoms admitted
by the profession of a Man-midwife?
Certainly no. Whoever reads the news-papers
of three years back, will find many
paragraphs informing us of prosecutions
of Men-midwives for crim. con.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“A man <i>never</i> seen by them <i>but in
their distress</i>, is sure most unlikely to
become an object <i>of their desire</i>; nor
can the ladies, however lovely in the
bloom of health, be supposed <i>capable of
retaining</i> their attractions <i>in the hour of
agony</i>.”—The writer knows that neither
of these assertions are matters of fact. In
regard to the first, <i>many women</i> see their
Men-midwives <i>in perfect health, to be informed
if they are with child? How far
gone?</i> “Whether the child lies right?”
and on many other <span class="smcap">pretences</span>.—Men and
women, on <i>such trying</i> occasions, <i>must
give way to <span class="smcap">nature</span>—there is no possibility
of withstanding it</i>.—As to women’s <i>not</i>
being “<i>attractingly lovely</i> when in labour,”—there
he likewise must have been sensible
that he erred from truth. Those
pains <i>rather add</i> to beauty; and though,
<i>during the continuance of racking tortures,
neither</i> party can attend to any thing but
the pains felt on one side, and the compassion
which a good man must sympathize
in on the other; yet <i>in the intervals</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
(many there <i>always</i> are, and <i>generally</i> they
are <i>long intervals</i>) <i>no uneasiness on either
side</i> leaves the minds <i>of both</i> at liberty to
entertain <i>other <span class="smcap">ideas</span></i>.</p>

<p>“And if he” (the Man-midwife) “is at
all to answer for their conduct, is, I
think, only to be reckoned with <i><span class="smcap">for
recovering them</span> so early</i>, and <i><span class="smcap">so
putting it in their power to</span> go
abroad</i> and <i><span class="smcap">coquet it</span> the sooner</i>.”—The
author is pleased to be <i>facetious with
the ladies</i>! I do not at all wonder that
<i>those men</i> who have <i>such foundation</i> for
censuring their conduct, <i>presume thus</i> to
ridicule them for their eagerness to visit,
in order to <i>receive the homage</i> of their <i>criminal
admirers</i>! I should have thought,
however, that the subject was not of a
nature which could authorize such indecent
raillery. It verifies the old proverb,
“<i>too much familiarity breeds contempt</i>.”</p>

<p>As to the assertion, that “the faculty
employ men to their own wives”—I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
very many instances to the contrary—and
even <i>if this was otherwise</i>, it would be by
no means conclusive. Men who have
<i>such choice</i> of fine women <i>to take the most
licentious liberties</i> with, most probably
cannot remain long faithful to their own
wives—they may therefore easily be supposed
soon to become so indifferent about
them, as to be very ready to suffer their
own brethren to lay them, <i>by way of
<span class="smcap">keeping up the farce</span></i>, and <i>blinding the
world</i>. I take for granted however they
permit <i>no private examinations</i>. They are
too much in the secret.</p>

<p>The gentleman concludes with telling
us a story of Dr. Ford’s having attended
a poor woman for three days and nights,
who had been ill used by a woman.⸺What
then?—It only proves that Dr.
Ford <i>is not destitute of humanity</i>, and <i>that
there is <span class="smcap">one</span></i> woman <i>who interfered with
nature</i>, and <i>of course did mischief</i>.—I know
he “is a favourite with many women of
distinction”—but <i>those ladies <span class="smcap">best</span> know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
<span class="smcap">how</span> he has recommended himself to their
favour</i>. Neither Dr. Ford, nor Dr.
Hunter, can presume to affirm, that they
never take the most intimate freedoms with
ladies, when there is no chance for labour.⸺Indeed,
the ladies make no secret
of it—they now can submit to those
examinations on the morning of an assembly,
tell their company of it at dinner,
and go to a tavern to supper!</p>

<p>And now, Mr. Printer, allow me <i>to
take my leave of you, and the public on
this theme</i>.—The unprejudiced will be
convinced—at least it was this flattering,
this most pleasing hope, that stimulated
me to write on this subject.—I can have no
sinister views—the conduct of the world
will not interfere with my happiness—for
I never will marry any woman, unless I
know her sentiments correspond with mine.
The public are now in possession of all
I can think on the subject—The good
sense of the people of England will decide
how far my hints may conduce to their domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
happiness.—I leave <i>to other pens</i> to
proceed on it, <i>in answer to any writer who
may enter the lists against me</i>. Whoever
wishes to know my sentiments may review
these three letters. I should be an
hypocrite, if I attempted to conceal, that,
as I took up my pen <i>for the benefit of the
community</i>, so I shall be <i>most highly gratified</i>,
if I hereafter find my time has been
employed to purpose, in <i>opening the
eyes of the thoughtless</i>, <i>informing the ignorant</i>,
and <i>warning the virtuous</i>. I despair
of shaming the immodest!</p>

<p>While I live, I shall think <span class="smcap">no woman
modest</span> who employs</p>

<p class="right">A MAN-MIDWIFE.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</h2>

</div>

<p>As I do not wish to bewilder the
Judgments of my Readers, but to
convince their Understandings,—and as
I have, throughout my Letters, laid so
much Weight on the Dangers which attend
hurrying the Labours of Women, I
cannot dismiss this Pamphlet into the
World without endeavouring <i>clearly to demonstrate</i>
the Utility of allowing Nature
<i>to adhere strictly</i> to <i>her own</i> Period for accomplishing
the Birth.</p>

<p>Men, who have <i>not</i> been <i>accustomed to
thinking</i>;—but whose Lives have been
spent in the various Occupations, or dissipated
Pleasures of the World, by having
been habituated daily to view the common
round which Providence takes in the
natural Events of Life, never felt their
Wonder and Admiration excited by considering
them in the Manner which is incumbent
on reasonable, intelligent Beings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Those, on the other Hand, whose only
<i>real</i> Enjoyments proceed from a delightful
Indulgement of the Soul in Contemplations
on the astonishing Works of God,
<i>divest</i> themselves of <i>that Familiarity to
them</i> which the hourly Evidence of their
Senses would otherwise have obscured—and
render’d Matter for no rational Reflection.</p>

<p>Thus we are blind to the surprizing
<i>progressive</i> Change, which enlarges a new
born Infant, to the size of Manhood! or
a small Seed, to a large Tree!—If an Infant,
<i>the day after its Birth</i>, was to walk
round the Town, in compleat symmetry
of Person, and six Feet high, would not
the Miracle forcibly strike the Minds of
the most thoughtless of our Species?—The
difference is made only <i>by Custom</i>.
Twenty Hours, and Twenty Years, are
exactly the same in the Sight of God!—<i>My</i>
Amazement is excited by seeing the
Change wrought <i>in twenty Years</i>, to the
full in <i>as high a degree</i>, as the <i>same Sight</i>,
in twenty <i>Hours</i>, would raise the Astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of an embroidered Maccaroni at
Carlisle House, or, of an infinitely <i>more</i>
rational, esteemable Being; a poor, ignorant
Labourer in the Fields!</p>

<p>The Work of Nature, <i>in Labour</i>, is one
of it’s most extraordinary Acts!—Untill
the Parts are <i>in some degree prepared</i> by the
miraculous Change effected in them <i>by the
Labour Pains</i>, the Child could no more
enter the World than it could fly into the
Clouds!—Untill the Parts are <i>properly</i>
prepared, the Child cannot appear without
<i>the most obvious</i> Danger.</p>

<p>Every Pain has it’s Office,—it lubricates—it
dilates. Where these Pains are
<i>not</i> violent—are <i>not</i> quick in their Return—but
are lingering, and tedious, they
<i>plainly</i> indicate that <i>the Woman requires
great Preparation</i>—Nature is <i>gradually</i>, and
by <i>the most gentle</i> Means, forwarding <i>the
Distension</i>—and if left <i>to herself</i>, will <i>not</i>
bring on the Birth till every thing <i>is accommodated
to her Purpose</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Men Midwives, seldom wait for Nature’s
Moment. Women are objected to, because
they are tedious—Men are extolled
for their quickness. If Doctor ⸺ has
two or three pregnant Ladies waiting,
from whom he expects handsome Payments,
he will <i>take Merit</i> from hastening
the Birth—and if any Accident happens
from his Impatience, his Reputation is
too well establish’d to suffer in the Eyes of
Mankind—and the Misfortune is attributed
to some of the common Casualties attending
Labour, when it derived it’s
Source <i>solely</i> from the Doctor’s having
brought the Child forward, <i>unnaturally</i>,
before the Parts were pre-disposed, by a
proper distension, for it’s Reception, and
Passage. I fear two Ladies died lately
owing to this very Practice. The Parts
inflamed—the Inflammation spread by
Sympathy—the Bowels mortified. If
these Ladies had lain-in in the Country,
and had employ’d common, plain Women,
who pretended to no Knowledge
but what they derived from Experience,
it is a Million to one that the Ladies would
now have been alive and well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The Men-midwives not only give rise
to Inflammations by bringing the Child
before the Woman has felt <i>half the number
of Pains</i> which Nature intended <i>to predispose</i>
the Parts—but likewise by <i>their
abominable Dilatations</i>. Can any Practice
be more repugnant to common Sense, than
that of irritating the exquisitely sensitive
nervous Fibres of those Parts, by way of
preparing them for Distension? The Men
absolutely <i>counteract</i> the very end they pretend
to have in view, by Dilatation!—Friction
must irritate—irritation must inflame—Inflammation
must <i>contract</i>. It
is no Wonder if Parts so nicely constructed—highly
irritated for (perhaps) Hours,
should inflame after the Birth, and be productive
of the most dreadful Consequences!—Yet
their <i>Officiousness</i> recommends
them to the Ladies!—I really cannot
find Words to inform my Readers
of every Circumstance I wish to relate. I
start Hints—and leave them to pursue
the Subject by an exertion of their own
Reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>I have now entirely done with all which
relates to the Danger Women and Children
run through <i>officious</i>, shameful <i>Impatience</i>.
I have only to recommend one
serious Reflection to those Husbands who
think their Happiness would be interrupted
by detecting any Infidelity in their
Wives. I beg they will consider <i>the Advantages</i>
they give Men-midwives, in allowing
them so many <i>favourable</i> Opportunities
of <i>extolling the personal</i> Charms of
the Ladies, <i>whose Beauties</i> lie open to their
<i>most curious</i> Researches. No Men can
possibly have <i>such critical</i> Opportunities for
engratiating themselves with the Fair.
<i>Flattery, <span class="smcap">critically</span> applied</i> to Women,
has strange Effects. They can <i>accompany</i>
their Flattery with <i>irresistible</i> Persuasives.
The sacred Names of Religion and Honour
<i>may</i> be made <i>Subservient</i> to their Purposes.
The more they are pretended to be
prized in their Estimation, the more <i>they
may be urged in proof</i> of the <i>bewitching</i> Allurements,
and <i>forcible</i> Power of those
hidden Beauties, which have obliterated
every Remonstrance of Virtue, and stifled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
every Check of Conscience. The poor
Woman’s <i>Pity</i> is excited, when she views
the strongest Principles of her “dear
Man” overcome by <i>her</i> Charms—she can
only blame <i>herself</i> for possessing <i>such provoking
Temptations</i>—she is blinded by the
Assistance of Nature—<i>her own Vanity</i> turns
Advocate for the Doctor, and acquits him
of Villainy <i>during the Empire of Passion</i>;
though the <i>return</i> of Reason, <i>when too
late</i>! discovers the Artifices which have
accomplish’d her Ruin!</p>

<p class="right">THE AUTHOR.</p>

<p>I hope Doctor Hunter will pardon <i>the
latter</i> part of the Reference, at the bottom
of my second Letter. I fear I misrepresented
him in attributing Infirmities to
his share which I am inform’d he never
yet has experienced. His <i>Abilities</i> are
great—and if a Man <i>must</i> be employ’d,
I think he may be called in with as much
safety as any Man of his Profession.</p>
